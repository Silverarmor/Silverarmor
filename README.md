### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Civil Engineering.

I'm currently working on the [spotDL](https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader/) project, providing user support, administration and developing.

My current personal project is my [flat dashboard](https://github.com/Silverarmor/j4dash), displaying on a screen in the living room of my flat!

Contact me on Discord `Silverarmor`
