### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Civil Engineering.

I have taken a backseat/admin role in the [@spotDL](https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader/) project, still providing user support but not actively developing.

No current projects, but a couple of ongoing items can be found in my repositories!

Contact me on Discord `Silverarmor`
